In front of their husbands. The Hadith bears this out, but the Hadith are so massive I don't know which one describes Mohammed giving his direct verbal permission for his soldiers to rape their slaves in front of their still-breathing but dying defeated husbands. 

Mohammed gave one of his Khalifs permission to cut a woman's head off and rape her while the blood poured from her neck at the feet of her husband.

"139","Ebba was killed as part of a larger attack, vs Alan Kurdi who was the only victim in that incident.  Searching CNN for Stockholm terror attack yields 41 results.  CNNs website search engine sucks (no predictive text or fuzzy search capabilities).  The only thing to see here is a bad search engine on a news site.  Drawing the conclusion that this coverage is politically/ideology motivated is not supported by facts. (Clearly the attack was motivated by twisted hateful beliefs that have no place in any society)

Stories with more than one victim typically arent indexed by a single victims name.  Coverage is equivalent on CNN when searching by a proper term for each respective incident.  It is tragic when any child dies, lets not cloud the tragedy with false narratives."
"140","Incorrect. When there are children involved, they are often able to be searched on news sites. Look up Charlotte bacon and Daniel barden, both sandy hook victims on CNN, and it'll link you to multiple articles about the incident. Look up Annabelle pomeroy, a victim of the texas church shooting, and you'll find multiple articles about it. When you look up ebba, there is nothing. "
"141","**You were downvoted to 0 by some idiot for saying this, here's an uptrump.**  I came here to see what method was used, and whether an [alternative approach](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bebba+%2Backerlund+site%3Acnn.com) might yield results.  Nope. It may be a narrative but not a false one.  

TIL there's a Reddit user Truck-O-Peace who focuses on these things.  *The oddity,* which most T_D commenters probably experience on some emotional level is WHY in this age of clickbait, sidebars and special interest followups... would *CNN pass over such a mention?*  It does not even make sense in context of a routine followup.  If the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Stockholm_attack) deigns to list names and CNN does not, it is reasonable to conclude that CNN may have gone out of its way *not* to mention facts available to them.  

Just from a few quick keyword searches,
[Name not mentioned.](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bebba+%2Backerlund+site%3Acnn.com). That's odd.  
[Fact that an 11 year old girl was among the victims?](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2B%28""girl+11""+OR+""11+year""%29+%2Bstockholm+%2Battack+site%3Acnn.com) Can't find that either. Getting weirder.  

IF an 11 year old girl was a tragic victim (sorry adults) around the world that's news *by any kind definition*.  Which is why there might be something *unhinged* or *unkind* going on at CNN.  

Perhaps the folks at CNN Money, while preparing for their [followup on Spotify executive Chris Bevington](http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/10/technology/spotify-executive-stockholm-attack/index.html) might have sent a memo along saying ""hey, about that 11-year old girl who was ripped in half...""
